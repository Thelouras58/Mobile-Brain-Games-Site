description: Pattern Lock Brain Games is my first personal production project. It’s an Android application that incudes a mini-game collection that requires a variety of thinking skills. The games are divided into 3 different categories, namely: Problem Solving, Memory and Brain Processing Speed.

Today, technology has advanced so far that you can practice your cognitive skills through a game app on your smartphone. So why not use it? We’re all playing games on our phones anyway—why not play one that can make a real difference in your health?

The games require not only concentration but also good observation and problem solving skills. Besides being challenging and addictive, these games will help sharpen your cognitive functions and keep your brain healthy.

The games included in the app were specifically designed to test how well you can recognize matching patterns, how well you can process information quickly, how quick you react to visual cues, and more.

This is a great way for older adults, children, teens and anyone else looking for a fun & challenging game to play.

I am glad to present you a new beta version of the Pattern Lock Brain Games Android Application. It is currently under development and has been launched in an internal close beta channel with over 10 testers.

The beta version includes two games: Draw the Number and Remember the Pattern, a Scoreboard for keeping track of your achievements, and some UI/UX experiments.

Draw the Numbers – your job is to reproduce a combination of numbers in the Pattern Lock as quickly and accurately as possible. You can have three levels of difficulty and compare your best times with your friend.

Remember the Pattern – in this game you have to remember a pattern that you will be shown for a short period of time. The longer you play, the more complicated it becomes. Be careful not to make any mistakes!

Both games are fun, simple, and easy to pick up, so dive in and dowloand the application!
